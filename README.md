# Coffee-Machine
This Python project simulates a coffee machine. It allows users to choose different types of coffee, processes the order, checks for sufficient resources, and updates the inventory accordingly. The goal is to create a simple but functional coffee machine model to practice object-oriented programming and handling user inputs.
